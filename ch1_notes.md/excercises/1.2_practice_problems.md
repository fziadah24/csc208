### 1. Statements About Shapes in the Safe:
In my safe is a sheet of paper with two shapes drawn on it in colored crayon. One is a diamond, and the other is a circle. Each shape is drawn in a single color. Suppose you believe me when I tell you that, "If the diamond is purple, then the circle is blue."  
What do you therefore know about the truth value of the following statements?
- **A.** Impossible to determine
- **B.** Impossible to determine
- **C.** False
- **D.** True
- **E.** True

### 2. Analyzing the Truth Value of Implications:
Suppose the statement, "If the circle is orange, then the square is purple," is true. Assume also that the converse is false. Classify each statement below as true or false (if possible).
- **A.** False
- **B.** True
- **C.** True
- **D.** False

### 3. Converse, Contrapositive, or Neither?
Consider the statement, "If you will give me magic beans, then I will give you a cow." Decide whether each statement below is the converse, the contrapositive, or neither.
- **A.** Neither
- **B.** Neither
- **C.** Neither
- **D.** Converse
- **E.** Contrapositive
- **F.** Neither

### 4. Viscosity of a Graph:
You have discovered an old paper on graph theory that discusses the viscosity of a graph (which for all you know, is something completely made up by the author). A theorem in the paper claims that “if a graph satisfies condition (V), then the graph is viscous.” Which of the following are equivalent ways of stating this claim? Which are equivalent to the converse of the claim?
- **A.** Converse
- **B.** Original
- **C.** Converse
- **D.** Converse
- **E.** Converse

### 5. Implication and Its Converse:
Which of the following statements are equivalent to the implication, "if you win the lottery, then you will be rich," and which are equivalent to the converse of the implication?
- **A.** Converse
- **B.** Original implication
- **C.** Converse
- **D.** Original implication
- **E.** Original implication

- **$\forall x (E(x) \to E(x+2))$**  
    For all $x$, if $x$ has property $E$, then $x+2$ also has property $E$

- **$\forall x \exists y (sin(x) = y)$**  
    For all $x$, there exists a $y$ such that $sin(x) = y$

- **$\forall y \exists x (sin(x) = y)$**  
    For all $y$, there exists an $x$ such that $sin(x) = y$

- **$\forall x \forall y (x^3 = y^3 \to x = y)$**  
    For all $x$ and for all $y$, if $x^3 = y^3$, then $x = y$
