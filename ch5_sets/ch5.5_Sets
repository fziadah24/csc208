# Chapter 5 - Problem 5

## Problem 5

Determine the smallest possible set that includes both `{1, 3, 9, 10}` and `{2, 3, 5, 7}` as subsets.

Define:

- `A = {1, 3, 9, 10}`
- `B = {2, 3, 5, 7}`

> Any set that includes `A` and `B` as subsets must contain all elements from both sets.

- The union of `A` and `B` is:
  `A âˆª B = {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10}`

- This union forms the smallest possible set that fully contains both subsets.
  Removing any element would mean one of the subsets is no longer entirely included.

**Final Answer:** `{1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10}`
