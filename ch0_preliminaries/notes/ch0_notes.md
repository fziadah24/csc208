# Discrete Math Notes

## Key Concepts

### What is Discrete Mathematics?
Discrete mathematics focuses on structures that are countable, distinct, and separate. Unlike continuous math, which deals with smooth functions and real numbers, discrete math is all about things like numbers, sets, and graphs that don’t blur together.

### Discrete Structures
These are the mathematical objects we use to model and solve problems. Some of the main discrete structures include:
- **Sets**: Collections of distinct elements.
- **Functions**: Rules that map inputs to exactly one output.
- **Sequences**: Ordered lists of elements.
- **Relations**: Connections between elements in sets.
- **Graphs**: Structures made up of nodes (vertices) and edges (connections).

## Definitions & Important Terms

### Sets & Cardinality
- **Set**: An unordered collection of unique elements.
- **Cardinality**: The number of elements in a set.
- **Set Notation**: Can be defined explicitly (e.g., `{1,2,3}`) or using set-builder notation (e.g., `{x | x < 10, x ∈ N}`).

### Functions & Their Properties
- **Function**: A mapping where each input has exactly one output.
- **Domain**: The set of all valid inputs.
- **Codomain**: The set of all possible outputs.
- **Range**: The actual outputs produced by a function.
- **Graph of a function**: A visual representation of input-output pairs.

### Sequences
- **Sequence**: An ordered list of elements.
- **Finite Sequence**: A sequence with a set number of terms.
- **Infinite Sequence**: A sequence that continues indefinitely.
- **Recursive Definition**: A way to define sequences by relating terms to previous terms.

### Relations & Their Properties
- **Relation**: A connection between elements of one or more sets.
- **Binary Relation**: A relation involving two elements (e.g., `<`, `=`).
- **Reflexive Relation**: Every element is related to itself.
- **Irreflexive Relation**: No element is related to itself.
- **Symmetric Relation**: If `a` is related to `b`, then `b` is related to `a`.
- **Antisymmetric Relation**: If `a` is related to `b` and `b` is related to `a`, then `a` and `b` must be the same.
- **Transitive Relation**: If `a` is related to `b` and `b` is related to `c`, then `a` is also related to `c`.
- **Equivalence Relation**: A relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

### Graphs
- **Graph**: A structure made up of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections).
- **Types of Graphs**:
  - **Undirected Graph**: Edges have no direction.
  - **Directed Graph (Digraph)**: Edges have a specific direction.
  - **Weighted Graph**: Edges have weights (e.g., distances in a travel network).
- **Examples of Graphs**:
  - **Geographical Graphs**: Cities as vertices, roads as edges.
  - **Flight Networks**: Airports as vertices, flights as edges.

## Questions & Answers

1. **What makes something discrete?**
   - A set like `{0,1,2,3}` is discrete because the elements are distinct. A function like `y = x^2` is not discrete because its outputs form a continuous curve.

2. **What are the four main topics in discrete math?**
   - Combinatorics (ways things combine), sequences, symbolic logic, and graph theory.

3. **What are discrete structures, and what are some examples?**
   - Discrete structures are mathematical models for problem-solving. Examples include:
     - **Sets**: Collections of elements.
     - **Functions**: Assignments of inputs to outputs.
     - **Sequences**: Ordered lists.
     - **Relations**: Descriptions of connections.
     - **Graphs**: Visual representations of relationships.
