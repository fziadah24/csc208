# I'm not a real scientist, and that's okay.
After reading this it got me thinking about how we see computer science. When he first got his BS, he thought of CS as a science, and when he got his PhD, he saw software engineering as a type of engineering. But over time, he started to see CS more like a branch of philosophy. This is because its theories and models aren't based on direct observations like traditional sciences. Wartik says that while CS takes ideas from math and engineering, it doesn't fit neatly into either category. Instead, its focus on logic and theoretical stuff makes it closer to philosophy.

I guess the reason we were asked to read this is to make us rethink how we view computer science. It's not just a straightforward science or engineering field. By understanding its philosophical side, we can appreciate its complexities better and approach problems more thoughtfully, which is super important if you're considering a career in CS.

Also, Wartik mentions John Hopcroft and Robert Tarjan, who are big names in computer science. Hopcroft is a professor at Cornell and is known for his work in algorithms and graph theory. He co-wrote "Introduction to Algorithms," which is like the bible for CS students. Tarjan, a professor emeritus at Princeton, is famous for his algorithms and data structures, including the Tarjan algorithm. Their work helped formalize CS and shift it towards mathematical theory, laying the groundwork for many techniques we use today.
