# Chapter 1.1: Mathematical Statements  

### Key Terms  
1. **Premise**: An assumption taken to be true as the starting point for an argument.  
2. **Conclusion**: The final statement drawn from a series of premises.  
3. **Argument**: A series of statements leading to a conclusion, where all but the last are premises.  
4. **Theorem**: A statement proven to be true using logic, definitions, axioms, or other theorems.  
5. **Proposition**: A declarative sentence that can only be true or false.  
6. **Proof**: A logical explanation that validates an argument.  
7. **Statement**: A declarative sentence with a definite truth value (true or false).  
8. **Quantifier**: Symbols that indicate how many elements in a set satisfy a condition.  
   - **Universal Quantifier** ($\forall$): Means "for all" or "every".  
   - **Existential Quantifier** ($\exists$): Means "there exists" or "for some".  
9. **Predicate**: Similar to a statement but contains variables that can change its truth value.  
10. **Logical Connective**: Words or symbols linking statements, like "and", "or", "if... then...", "not".  
11. **Binary Connective**: Connects two statements, e.g., "and" ($\land$), "or" ($\lor$), "if... then..." ($\to$), "if and only if" ($\leftrightarrow$).  
12. **Unary Connective**: Applies to one statement, like "not" ($\neg$).  
13. **Truth Value**: Whether a proposition is true or false.  
14. **Propositional Variables**: Symbols representing statements, usually P, Q, R, S, etc.  
15. **Conjunction** ($\land$): Combines two statements using "and"; true only if both statements are true.  
16. **Disjunction** ($\lor$): Combines two statements using "or"; true if at least one statement is true.  
17. **Implication** ($\to$): An "if... then..." statement; false only if the first part is true and the second part is false.  
18. **Conditional**: Another term for implication.  
19. **Biconditional** ($\leftrightarrow$): Combines two statements using "if and only if"; true when both statements are either true or false.  
20. **Negation** ($\neg$): Indicates the opposite of a statementâ€™s truth value.  
21. **Truth Conditions**: The logical circumstances under which a statement is considered true.  
22. **Universal Generalization**: A statement made universally true by adding quantifiers to bind all variables.
